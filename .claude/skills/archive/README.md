# Archived Skill Drafts

These files are legacy, pre-skill-folder drafts that were replaced by structured skills under `<repo-root>/.claude/skills/`.

Kept for historical reference and content comparison. Do not edit or use directly.

To use the updated skills, open the corresponding skill folder and reference its `SKILL.md`.
