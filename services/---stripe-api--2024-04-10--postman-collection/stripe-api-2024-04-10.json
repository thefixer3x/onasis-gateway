As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>\n\n<p>You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> value passed in the request.</p>",

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.\n\nUse `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.\n\nUse `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).\n\nUse `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more."

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.\n\nUse `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.\n\nUse `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).\n\nUse `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more."

For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.\n\nUse `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the PaymentIntent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice, such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the PaymentIntent is not confirmed within 23 hours Subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.\n\nUse `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice can't be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further customer action is needed, this parameter doesn't create a Subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.\n\n`pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a Subscription.\n\nSubscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are automatically activated regardless of the first Invoice status."

For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a <currency>100</currency> price, they’ll be billed <currency>100</currency> immediately. If on May 15 they switch to a <currency>200</currency> price, then on June 1 they’ll be billed <currency>250</currency> (<currency>200</currency> for a renewal of her subscription, plus a <currency>50</currency> prorating adjustment for half of the previous month’s <currency>100</currency> difference). Similarly, a downgrade generates a credit that is applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes.</p>\n\n<p>Switching prices does not normally change the billing date or generate an immediate charge unless:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The billing interval is changed (for example, from monthly to yearly).</li>\n<li>The subscription moves from free to paid, or paid to free.</li>\n<li>A trial starts or ends.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In these cases, we apply a credit for the unused time on the previous price, immediately charge the customer using the new price, and reset the billing date.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to charge for an upgrade immediately, pass <code>proration_behavior</code> as <code>always_invoice</code> to create prorations, automatically invoice the customer for those proration adjustments, and attempt to collect payment. If you pass <code>create_prorations</code>, the prorations are created but not automatically invoiced. If you want to bill the customer for the prorations before the subscription’s renewal date, you need to manually <a href=\"/docs/api/invoices/create\">invoice the customer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t want to prorate, set the <code>proration_behavior</code> option to <code>none</code>. With this option, the customer is billed <currency>100</currency> on May 1 and <currency>200</currency> on June 1. Similarly, if you set <code>proration_behavior</code> to <code>none</code> when switching between different billing intervals (for example, from monthly to yearly), we don’t generate any credits for the old subscription’s unused time.

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.\n\nUse `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.\n\nUse `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).\n\nUse `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more."

    "description": "\n## Stripe API Postman Collection\nThis is a postman collection covering the Stripe API. See https://stripe.com/docs/api for more details.\n## Prerequisites\n[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)\n\n[Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n## Getting Started\nTo get started fork the collection from [Stripe's public workspace](https://www.postman.com/stripedev/workspace/stripe-developers/overview) within Postman.\n\n![Fork collection](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_collection.png)\n\nEnter a name for your fork and select the workspace where it will be created:\n\n![Fork form](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_form.png)\n\nYou can also fork the environment template from the Stripe Developers Workspace:\n\n![Fork environment template](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_env_template.png)\n\n### Set your API key\nTo run requests you'll need to supply your [testmode secret API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) and set it as an [environment variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) within your workspace.\n\nTo set any environment variable, create a new envionment within Postman:\n\n![create a new environment](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_new_env.png)\n\nAdd your secret key as a variable to the environment and save:\n\n![set API key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_key_and_save.png)\n\nSet the environment to active:\n\n![save as active](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_active_env.png)\n\nNow within the collection set it to use the environment you just created:\n\n![set collection environment](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_collection_environment.png)\n\nIf your environment is set up correctly, you should see your secret key value if you mouse over the `secret_key` variable in the Token field:\n\n![secret key mouseover](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_secret_key_mouseover.png)\n\n\n\nBe sure to save the collection after you've configured the set the key:\n\n![save key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_save_key.png)\n\n## Make a test call\nYou should be ready now to make a test call. An easy first call is to create a customer:\n\n![customer endpoints](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_customer_endpoints.png)\n\nSince no parameters are required to create a customer, you can just hit the Send button to run this request:\n\n![create customer send](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_send.png)\n\nIf your environment is set up you'll get a customer object back as the response to the call:\n\n![create customer send](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_customer_create_no_params_response.png)\n\n\nAdd parameters to the call by clicking the body tab, where you'll see a list of available parameters.  Select and populate the ones you want to use. Here's an example of adding an email parameter:\n\n![create customer with email](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_with_email_request.png)\n\nYou'll see the email address in the reponse:\n\n![create customer with email](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_with_email_response.png)\n\n## Passing Metadata In a Request\nRight now [metadata](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) does not show up as a optional parameter on requests, but it can still be provided to calls that will accept it.  Here's an example of adding 2 metadata fields to the customer create call:\n\n![set metadata on a request](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_metadata.png)\n\nMetadata key value pairs can be updated in a similar manner. To remove a metadata key during an update call, supply the `metadata[key]` parameter without setting a value.  This will pass an empty string as part of the request:\n\n![clear metadata key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_update_metadata.png)\n\nTo remove all metadata pass the `metadata` parameter without a value set:\n\n![remove metadata key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_remove_metadata.png)\n\n## Changelog\nTo keep track of major Stripe API updates and version, reference the [API upgrades page](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#api-versions) in our documentation.
